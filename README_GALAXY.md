# ðŸ“Š Metrics README

This document outlines the full set of **business and operational metrics** modeled across the enterprise Galaxy Schema for TKE.

Metrics are grouped by domain and tied to their respective **fact tables** (OLAP layer), enabling robust analytics and executive reporting. Each metric is classified by **type**:
- **Scalar** â€“ A single aggregated value (e.g., total revenue)
- **Vector** â€“ Aggregated by one dimension (e.g., margin by region)
- **Matrix** â€“ Aggregated by two dimensions (e.g., cost by department and time)

These metrics serve multiple business functions:
- Sales performance tracking
- Marketing attribution and ROI
- Customer service optimization
- Financial reconciliation (AR, cost centers)
- Management accounting and allocation analysis
- Cross-system analytics (Salesforce + SAP)

This document complements the **OLAP diagram** and supports BI layer implementation (Power BI, Tableau, etc.).

# ðŸ“ˆ OLAP Metrics Diagram â€“ Galaxy Schema Overview

This diagram represents the OLAP layer for a **Galaxy Schema** architecture designed for TKE, integrating metrics across **Salesforce**, **SAP**, and other enterprise systems. 

Each fact table (e.g., `FactOpportunity`, `FactCost`, `FactInvoice`) is modeled as a **star schema**, and the constellation of these facts forms a **Galaxy Schema**.

---

## ðŸŒ€ Galaxy Architecture Notes

- **Fact Tables:** Represent core business processes (e.g., Sales Pipeline, Campaign Response, Invoicing, Cost Accounting).
- **Shared Dimensions:** `DimTime`, `DimRegion`, `DimProduct`, `DimAccount`, and `DimCurrency` serve as **wormholes**, enabling cross-fact analysis.
- **Metrics:** Grouped by business domain, classified as scalar, vector, or matrix.
- **Integration Points:**
  - Salesforce â†” SAP revenue/cost alignment
  - Marketing â†” Opportunity influence tracking
  - Finance â†” Cost center reporting and allocations

---

## ðŸ§­ Example Wormholes (Shared Dimensions)

| Wormhole Dimension | Used In                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `DimTime`           | All fact tables â€” time alignment              |
| `DimProduct`        | Opportunity, Quote, Order, Revenue, Cost      |
| `DimRegion`         | Opportunity, Campaign, Cost, Revenue          |
| `DimAccount`        | CRM (Sales), Invoicing, Costing               |
| `DimCurrency`       | Finance, Revenue, Cost â€” for FX normalization|

---

## ðŸ”§ Usage

The following Mermaid diagram maps each **metric** to its source **fact table**, forming a visual OLAP layer to support:
- Executive dashboards
- Departmental KPIs
- Financial consolidation
- Cross-system audits and reconciliations
